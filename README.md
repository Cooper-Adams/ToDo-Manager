# ToDo-Manager

The ToDo-Manager is exactly what the title implies, a hub for your all of your To-Do tasks. 

The manager should allow the user to create a To-Do item that contains a title, a description, a date, and a priority. The user should have the ability to edit and delete their To-Dos individually after their creation. The user should NOT be able to add notes with a date that is before the current date. After creation, the user should be able to click on the To-Do item and view its full details. In each category, the To-Do items should be sorted by decreasing priority.

Each To-Do item will be added to the category that the user is within on the page. 
    
    
Default categories include:

Today - users notes that match the current date

Upcoming - users notes that are not "due" until later dates

Projects - has subcategories of user created Projects, will contain a scroll for when more than 4-5 are added

Notes - a tab that contains "sticky notes" created by the user, just small, quick message boxes that only require a title (and the option of a description)


Theses categories will be displayed in a menu on the left of the screen taking approximately 1/4 of the display, while the other 3/4 contains the To-Do items.

In addition, the menu should contain a button to add a new To-Do, Project Tab, or Note. The To-Do is added to the tab that the user is in at the time of creation, the Project is appended to the list of Projects, and the Note is added to the top of the Notes section.
